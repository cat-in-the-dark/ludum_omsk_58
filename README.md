## Genre
Cooperative Split-screen 3D-platformer

## Synopsys
Two girls somehow got lost in cyberdream
They tries to reach reality by:
- collecting cats
- openning doors
- pulling and pushing boxes (and each other)
- saving respawn point at cat-chy TVs
- trying to make sense of the place where they appeared

## How to play:
- Open door with two pressing plates (they cover the floor and look fancy) to go for a flushing escape.
- There are two boxes on the map to keep the door open for both of you.
- Dying with box in hand would ressurect you with same box, fancy
- Box will return to spawn point if lost in pit below.
- Collect all the cats if you dare.
